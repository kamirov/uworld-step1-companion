    definition:
      "Inflammation of the meninges (dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater) surrounding the brain and spinal cord — most often infectious (bacterial, viral, fungal, or mycobacterial) but can be chemical or autoimmune — presenting with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and CSF abnormalities on lumbar puncture.",
    pathophysiology:
      "Bloodborne or contiguous spread of pathogens across the blood–brain barrier or from adjacent infection (sinusitis, otitis, mastoiditis) → meningeal inflammation → ↑ intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and irritation of pain-sensitive meninges; bacterial meningitis triggers intense neutrophilic exudate and endotoxin-mediated injury; impaired CSF resorption and BBB dysfunction cause ↓ CSF glucose and ↑ protein.",
    classicPresentation: [
      "Acute fever, severe headache, neck stiffness (nuchal rigidity)",
      "Photophobia, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status",
      "Kernig and Brudzinski signs (meningeal irritation)",
      "Petechial/purpuric rash in meningococcemia (Neisseria meningitidis)",
      "Neonate — nonspecific sepsis picture: fever or hypothermia, lethargy, poor feeding, bulging fontanelle",
      "Subacute/chronic course suggests TB, fungal, or partially treated bacterial meningitis",
    ],
    keyFindings: [
      "Lumbar puncture with opening pressure, cell count/differential, glucose, protein, Gram stain, culture",
      "Bacterial CSF — ↑ WBC (neutrophils), ↑ protein, ↓ glucose (<40 mg/dL or <50–60% serum), ↑ opening pressure",
      "Viral (aseptic) CSF — ↑ WBC (lymphocytes), normal glucose, normal/mildly ↑ protein",
      "TB/fungal CSF — lymphocytic pleocytosis, very ↑ protein, ↓ glucose (subacute)",
      "CT head before LP if focal neuro signs, papilledema, seizures, or immunocompromise (↑ herniation risk)",
      "Blood cultures positive in many bacterial meningitis cases even before CSF culture",
    ],
    keyLabs: [
      "CSF analysis — diagnostic cornerstone",
      "Blood cultures — often positive in bacteremia/meningitis",
      "PCR panels (CSF) — rapid detection of bacterial and viral pathogens",
      "Cryptococcal antigen (CSF/serum) — HIV/AIDS meningitis",
      "India ink stain — Cryptococcus in CSF",
    ],
    associations: [
      "Streptococcus pneumoniae — most common bacterial cause in adults; post-splenectomy and elderly risk",
      "Neisseria meningitidis — adolescents, college dormitories, military recruits; petechiae and Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome",
      "Haemophilus influenzae type b — decreased after Hib conjugate vaccine; unvaccinated children",
      "Neonatal: Group B Streptococcus, E. coli (K1), Listeria monocytogenes",
      "Listeria — elderly, pregnant, immunocompromised; ampicillin required (resistant to 3rd-gen cephalosporins)",
      "Cryptococcus neoformans — HIV/AIDS with CD4 <100",

      "Death or neurologic disability if treatment delayed",
    ],
    distinguishFrom: [
      "Encephalitis — parenchymal brain inflammation; altered mental status/seizures predominate; HSV PCR in CSF",
      "Subarachnoid hemorrhage — thunderclap headache; xanthochromia and RBCs in CSF (not cleared by centrifugation)",
      "Brain abscess — focal neuro deficits; ring-enhancing lesion on imaging",
      "Meningism without meningitis — neck pain from other causes; normal CSF",
      "Lyme meningitis — lymphocytic CSF; tick exposure; erythema migrans history",
      "Carcinomatous meningitis — malignant cells in CSF; subacute course in cancer patients",
    ],
    treatment: [
      "Empiric bacterial meningitis (adults): vancomycin + ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime); add ampicillin if Listeria risk (age >50, neonate, immunocompromised, pregnant)",
      "Neonatal empiric: ampicillin + gentamicin or cefotaxime",
      "Dexamethasone given with or just before first antibiotic dose in suspected pneumococcal meningitis (↓ mortality/hearing loss)",
      "Adjust antibiotics to culture/sensitivity; Listeria requires ampicillin (not ceftriaxone alone)",
      "Viral meningitis — supportive care; acyclovir if HSV encephalitis cannot be excluded",
      "Cryptococcal — amphotericin B + flucytosine induction, then fluconazole maintenance in HIV",
      "TB meningitis — RIPE + dexamethasone per protocol",
      "Close contacts of N. meningitidis — chemoprophylaxis (e.g., rifampin, ciprofloxacin)",

    boardsPearls: [
      "Meningitis triad — fever, headache, neck stiffness (may be incomplete early)",
      "Bacterial CSF: ↑ neutrophils, ↑ protein, ↓ glucose; Viral: ↑ lymphocytes, normal glucose",
      "S. pneumoniae #1 adults; N. meningitidis in teens/young adults with petechiae; neonates → GBS, E. coli, Listeria",
      "Add ampicillin for Listeria coverage in neonates, elderly, immunocompromised — cephalosporins don't cover Listeria",
      "Dexamethasone + antibiotics for pneumococcal meningitis — give before or with first antibiotic dose",
      "Don't delay antibiotics for CT/LP if bacterial meningitis suspected — treat empirically",
      "CT before LP if focal deficits, papilledema, or altered mental status to reduce herniation risk",
